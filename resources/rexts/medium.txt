Learning to type quickly and accurately
is a very useful skill. With constant practice,
you can improve your typing speed significantly.
Many people find it difficult to type without
looking at the keyboard, but over time your
fingers will remember the positions. Make sure
to sit in a good posture and avoid looking down
at your hands. Small habits make a big difference in the
long run. Patience and consistency are key to mastering touch typing.
