The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Birds fly high in the sky. Children love to play in the park. A cat sleeps on the warm window sill. Trees give us fresh air. Reading books is a good habit. Apples are red and bananas are yellow. The dog barked loudly at the stranger. Water is important for all living beings. Always be kind to others.
The cat sat on the mat.
Typing is fun.
Hello world.
Keep practicing typing.
